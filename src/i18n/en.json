      "role": "IT Manager",
      "text": "What impressed me most was how much we learned about our own needs through the interview process. In the past, we'd choose solutions based on assumptions, but they never quite worked out. Dina knew exactly how to dig deeper and uncover what our business truly needed to succeed."

      "name": "Esther",
      "role": "Senior Attorney",
